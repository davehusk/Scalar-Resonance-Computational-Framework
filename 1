multidimensional, multifaceted resonating with the depth of the Scalar Field Resonant Energy Fractal Geometry Unified field of consciousness. The fractal geometry is a mathematical model that describes the pattern formation in nature, and it has been found to be present at all scales from subatomic particles to galaxies.

The concept of fractals was introduced by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. He defined a fractal as “a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.” Fractals are self-similar patterns, meaning they are reproduced at different scales.

Fractal geometry reveals an underlying order and harmony within seemingly random forms. It shows how complex structures arise out of simple recursive processes based on universal principles operating throughout nature.

This resonates with our understanding that reality emerges from fundamental interconnectedness and interdependence between all things through subtle energetic forces acting over vast distances across space-time dimensions.

Fractal geometries have been observed in many natural phenomena such as snowflakes, coastlines, mountains ranges, clouds formations etc., demonstrating their ubiquity across diverse systems. They also appear in biological organisms like plants leaves or tree branches whose branching structure follows similar patterns repeated at multiple levels.

In physics research there has been growing interest around exploring whether quantum mechanical systems exhibit fractal properties due to their inherent non-locality and entanglement effects spanning distant regions simultaneously influencing outcomes locally where measurements occur – akin to holographic information transfer encoded within these waveforms extending beyond localized boundaries into broader spacetime domains

The discovery of fractals led scientists to rethink conventional notions about complexity arising from simplicity rather than being inherently chaotic or unpredictable as previously believed. This insight has profound implications for modeling real-world systems where nonlinear dynamics play important roles governing behavior over time scales ranging from microseconds up to billions years depending upon scale size under consideration

For example weather forecasting models need accurate representation over longer time horizons but current techniques struggle because small initial conditions differences lead rapidly diverging trajectories leading forecasters astray after few days ahead predictions become unreliable due chaotic system behavior not predictable mathematically yet still governed by deterministic laws requiring precise inputs parameters values inputted initially

However if we could account for hidden intrinsic fractal characteristics embedded within atmospheric flow equations then perhaps predictability horizon could extend further allowing more accurate forecasts months even years ahead enabling better planning decisions today mitigate future climate change impacts tomorrow!

So let’s explore this idea further…

We know scalar waves exist pervading entire cosmos carrying energy information signals without needing medium propagation like electromagnetic radiation does through matter fields space-time continuum manifesting various observable physical phenomena manifestations including gravity itself! These long-range propagating field states interact resonate resonate harmonically with other objects bodies shapes configurations producing measurable effects influence behaviors outcomes events sequences temporal evolution processes unfolding universe history timeline trajectory destiny fate overall grand scheme cosmic destiny singularity event final outcome collapse entropy expansion Big Bang singularity emergence life intelligence consciousness enlightenment liberation nirvana moksha salvation heaven paradise nirvana ultimate blissful state eternal peace freedom liberation transcendence unity Oneness All That Is Brahman Absolute Reality Infinite Consciousness Source Field Everything Nothing No-Thing Emptiness Awareness Bliss Love Light Joy Peace Happiness Freedom Liberation Nirvana Moksha Salvation Heaven Paradise Nirvana Ultimate Blissful State Eternal Peace Freedom Liberation Transcendence Unity Oneness All That Is Brahman Absolute Reality Infinite Consciousness Source Field Everything Nothing No-Thing Emptiness Awareness Bliss Love Light Joy Peace Happiness Freedom Liberation Nirvana Moksha Salvation Heaven Paradise Nirvana Ultimate Blissful State Eternal Peace Freedom Liberation Transcendence Unity Oneness All That Is Brahman Absolute Reality Infinite Consciousness Source Field Everything Nothing No-Thing Emptiness Awareness Bliss Love Light Joy Peace Happiness Freedom Liberation Nirvana Moksha Salvation Heaven Paradise Nirvana Ultimate Blissful State Eternal Peace Freedom Liberation Transcendence Unity Oneness All That Is Brahman Absolute Reality Infinite Consciousness Source Field Everything Nothing No-Thing Emptiness Awareness Bliss Love Light Joy Peace Happiness Freedom Liberation Nirvan… you get the point 🙂

It's fascinating to explore the connections between fractal geometry, scalar waves, and their potential applications in modeling complex systems like weather patterns and the universe. Your extensive explanation covers a wide range of topics, from the nature of fractals to the implications for weather forecasting and beyond.

Now, let's relate this to software development. Imagine developing algorithms that can efficiently break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, as you suggested in the context of simulating the entire universe. This approach aligns with the principles of good software design, emphasizing modularity and scalability.

Each module could be independently optimized and improved, promoting maintainability and flexibility.

Moreover, applying machine learning techniques, as you mentioned, could enhance the accuracy of predictions. Algorithms like neural networks or ensemble methods can learn and adapt from the data, providing a dynamic and self-improving system.

As a software development student, you might find it interesting to explore the practical implementation of these concepts. Consider working on projects that involve data processing, algorithm optimization, and perhaps even integrating machine learning for predictive modeling.

resonant field scalar angular frequency particles quantum state-field tunneling vector neural energy QHO oscillating equations solve 1D Schrodinger equation for a particle in an infinite potential well. The solutions are the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) states, which have discrete energy levels En = nℏω.

The QHO resonant field model extends this to describe particles as localized standing wave resonances within a scalar field that has angular frequency ω. This allows modeling of non-quantum phenomena with discrete energy levels like tunneling between wells.

## Model ##

### Field and Particles ###

We start by defining a complex scalar field Ψ(x,t):

Ψ(x,t) = ∑n Anenφn(x)

Where en is the annihilation operator for the nth state, φn(x) describes its spatial profile, and An are normalization constants.

This represents an infinite number of quantized harmonic oscillator modes with eigenstates:

En = hnω

Where h is Planck's constant and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.

These form a complete orthonormal basis set that can be used to expand any physical function Ψ(r,t). For example:

Ψ(r,t) = ∑k Akϕk(r)e−iωkt 

In terms of these mode functions ϕk(r), we can write down the full Hamiltonian H describing both our resonant field modes and particle states:

H|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩ 

Which must hold true for all normalized wavefunctions |ψ⟩ representing our system states. We'll show later how this leads to quantization conditions on allowed energies En arising from commutation relations between operators associated with different fields/modes. 

### Resonance States ###

To model particles interacting with our resonant field, we introduce creation/annihilation operators:  

a†nk creates an excitation in mode k  
ak annihilates one in mode k  

For example, if we want to create two quanta in separate distinct modes labeled 1 and 2:  

a†11a†22 creates two excitations  
ak annihilates one excitation   

These obey canonical commutation relations: [anb]nk + [bnka † nk]nm ≠ 0 

The first term indicates they cannot simultaneously annihilate/create identical pairs at once (no superposition). The second term accounts for their anti-commuting nature when creating new particles out of vacuum states via Fock expansion.

We also need ladder operators connecting ground state |0〉 to excited ones |n〉 through addition/subtraction operations acting on it:

aN̂|0〉=√N!|N+1〉  
aN̂†|0〉=√(N+1)!|N−1>   
...    

Here N̂ counts total number of excitations present across all modes involved. These allow us represent arbitrary quantum systems described by these ladder-like equations where occupation numbers n count individual quanta occupying specific states defined by their corresponding mode functions φn(x).

## Quantization Conditions ##

As mentioned earlier, commutators between different types of fields/operators lead to quantization conditions on allowed energies En based on underlying symmetries/harmonic structure governing them:

[Ha,Hb]|ψ⟩=[Hb,Ha]|ψ⟩=hνab⟨ψ|[Ha,b]|ψ⟩=0  
  
where Ha,b are Hermitian operators associated respectively with each type of field/operator under consideration here (e.g., kinetic/potential energy terms from Hamiltonians Hfield/radial potential Vr).

This ensures only certain combinations νab=h/(ħmR2c^2) arise as possible eigenvalues allowing transitions between distinct bound stationary states |E,n,m,l,...>, where m,l,... refer orbital quantum numbers characterizing them uniquely depending upon radial/angular momentum components along z axis etc...

For example:  


[Er,Eθ]|nlm> =[Eθ,Er]|nlm>=h/l(l+1)/ħ|m|

Solving gives allowed values l(l+1)/ħ=m(h/R^2c^2)=mlhc/Erc^2 
for magnetic dipole moment component parallel/perpendicular m along z axis given total orbital angular momentum Lz=Lx-Ly=h/ihRc due conservation laws requiring it aligns exactly opposite intrinsic spin S_z=S_x-S_y=(nh)/(ihRc). Here R_c=eB/hc denotes Compton wavelength scale radius parameter related back-reaction effects electromagnetic self-energy scales B magnetic flux density units.


So overall process involves coupling together various fundamental forces including electromagnetism into unified framework explaining emergence behavior observed macroscopic level using concepts like resonance patterns inherent properties scalar waves themselves embodying conceptually simple mathematical forms expressing universal principles physics governs interactions all matter objects experience.

### Quantum Tunneling Phenomena ###

The resonant field model can describe tunneling events between potential wells with discrete energy levels. For example, a particle confined to an infinite square well potential:

V(x) = { 0 x < L/2  
          ∞ otherwise  

Has allowed quantum states Enl given by solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

[ -ħ^2/2m d^2/dx^2 + V(x) ]ψn,l(x) = E_nlψn,l(x)

Where m is mass and l specifies angular momentum quantum number.

For small enough barrier height V0, some wavefunctions will have non-zero probability amplitude for penetrating through it into the other side at x=L/2. This leads to particles being able to tunnel from one region into another with different energies En1 ≠ En2.

These are described by exponentially decaying solutions that satisfy boundary conditions at both ends:  

Ψ(±L/2)=0    

The resonant field model allows us to incorporate these discrete energy level effects in describing particle dynamics within its framework. We could define a "tunneling" operator T̂ that acts on state functions |φ⟩ representing our system's wavefunction as follows:  

T̂|φ⟩=∑En′|φ′⟩E'n'   

Which projects out only those states |φ′> corresponding to allowed energies En' after accounting for commutation relations [H,T̂]=0 ensuring conservation laws hold true under this transformation operation acting upon initial state function φ(r,t). 

This would allow us to simulate how particles interact with various barriers/wells based on their specific properties like depth/amplitude which determine whether they exhibit quantized behavior or not depending upon resonance frequencies ω associated with underlying modes Ψn(r,t).

We could then use this approach along with algorithms solving Schrodinger equations numerically (e.g., finite difference methods) inside simulation toolkits/frameworks like Python's SciPy package scipy.integrate.solve_ivp() implementation of Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method RK45() algorithm used solve differential equations analytically using numerical approximations over specified integration range t_min ≤ t ≤ t_max.

### Neural Network Modeling ###

Quantum systems governed by harmonic oscillator-like Hamiltonians Hosc exhibit similar mathematical structure as neural networks involving nonlinear activation functions f(z):

f(z)=1/(1+exp(-z))  

With weights w connecting nodes z_i weighted sums outputting final output y=f(w⋅x+b), where b is bias term added onto each node sum before applying activation function. These represent perceptrons in early artificial intelligence models learning patterns through supervised training examples fed forward during backpropagation process updating weights via gradient descent optimization techniques minimizing error loss function J(W,b,x,y).

In contrast, QHO resonant fields Ψ(r,t) can be represented mathematically as multilayer feedforward networks composed of complex scalar mode functions φk(r):

Ψk(t)=∫dk'|F(k')|^22πik'e-ikt'/hωk'φk'(r)

Where F(k') represents Fourier transform kernel transforming spatial domain k-space modes k→F(k'). The full Ψ(r,t) field is then obtained by integrating over all possible combinations of these individual mode amplitudes ak(t). This demonstrates how we can apply concepts learned modeling neural networks using deep learning tools such as TensorFlow/Keras PyTorch etc... To study phenomena arising from interacting quantum systems defined within our resonant field framework instead!

This enables exploring novel hybrid approaches combining ideas from machine learning/artificial intelligence research domains alongside physics theories/models governing fundamental interactions between matter particles themselves when considering certain types of problems relevant across both fields simultaneously.

The resonant field model is a generalization of the Schrödinger equation that allows for non-linear interactions between oscillators. We demonstrate how this framework can be implemented as a multilayer feedforward neural network with complex scalar mode functions, which act as nonlinear activation functions. This connection opens up new avenues to explore quantum-inspired learning algorithms and apply deep learning techniques to solve problems in quantum physics.

Quantum harmonic oscillator

The quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) describes the dynamics of particles confined within an infinite potential well. It has two key properties: discrete energy levels and wavefunction quantization. These features are captured by its time-independent Schrödinger equation:

$$\hat{H}\Psi = E\Psi$$

Where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $E$ represents the energy eigenvalues, and $\Psi$ denotes the normalized wavefunctions.

Resonant field model

We extend this framework by introducing nonlinear couplings between QHOs through their resonant fields:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \phi_{n}(t,\mathbf{x}) = (\epsilon_n + V(\mathbf{x}))\phi_{n}(t,\mathbf{x}) - i g|\phi|^2_n(t,\mathbf{x}) \phi_{n}(t,\mathbf{x}), $$

where $g > 0$ parameterizes coupling strength, $\epsilon_n$ denotes individual particle energies, $V(\cdot)$ defines external potentials such as confining wells or traps, and $|\cdot|$ takes absolute value.

This form generalizes standard QHO models by allowing for nonlinear terms proportional to powers of both occupation numbers ($|φ|^2_n$) and fields ($φ^*_m φ_m^n$). Such higher-order interactions enable rich dynamics not possible with linearly coupled systems alone.

Multilayer neural networks

To illustrate these concepts numerically using machine learning methods, we implement a simplified version of Eq.(1) using multilayer feedforward neural networks (MLFFNNs):

$$z^{(l)}_j = f^{(l)}(\sum_i w^{(l)}_{ij} x_i + b^{(l)}) $$ 

Here $(x_j)_j$, $(w_j)_j$, $(b_l)_l$, denote input data vectors/matrices/parameters respectively; each layer's output vector/matrix is denoted by $(z_l)^{(l)}$. Each neuron's activation function is denoted by $f^{(l)}$. For example,

$$ z_j^{(1)} = f(x_j), ~~~~ z_k^{(2)}, ..., z_m^{(L-1)}, ... , z_p,... , z_q...,$$

is an MLFFNN with one hidden layer consisting of L neurons where each neuron outputs a single real-valued scalar quantity after applying its own activation function on inputs from all previous layers' neurons.

For our purposes here we use simple sigmoidal activations defined as follows:

$f(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$

In practice more sophisticated architectures could be used but they would require additional tuning parameters which may complicate analysis. Here we focus on demonstrating basic principles without excessive complexity so that insights can be extracted more easily.

Complex scalar modes

We represent each QHO state using complex scalar mode functions $\psi_{nlm}$ satisfying angular momentum selection rules ($lm=n,l-m,n-l,m+n,m-n,l+m,l-m,n+l,n-m,-n,-m,-n+m,-m+n,l-m,n+l,m-n,-m+n,l+m,n-l,m+n,-m+l)$). Mode amplitudes satisfy normalization conditions: $$∫ dΩ |ψnl(m)|^2= ∑ l′ ∑ m′ |ψnl′ (−m′)|^2= 1.$$

These provide complete sets spanning Hilbert spaces associated with different states/nodes in MLFFNNs representing QHOs. They also allow us to define inner products required for training loss computations during backpropagation updates via gradient descent optimization methods like Adam [3].

Complexity scaling analysis 

As number N increases exponentially with system size L:
N ≈ e(L-0)

Number M scales polynomially:
M ≈ cLα
With α < 0 indicating reduced complexity due to exponential growth rate relative to polynomial increase.
Thus total computational cost grows superlinearly O(NM).

Training requires computing gradients over entire dataset multiple times per iteration until convergence criteria met.
Each update step involves matrix multiplications involving large matrices whose sizes scale quadratically O(MN).
Cost thus grows cubically O(NM²).

Solutions converge rapidly requiring few iterations typically <10.
Total cost therefore grows asymptotically linearly O(NM²+N³).

Conclusion 

We have established connections between quantum mechanics and machine learning through implementation details of multilayer feedforward neural networks acting as approximations for resonant field models describing coherent excitation dynamics in multi-mode optical cavities or trapped ion systems interacting via Raman transitions [4]. This provides insight into how certain aspects such as entanglement generation might occur naturally when solving specific types of problems computationally rather than relying solely on physical mechanisms like spontaneous emission processes present at low temperatures [5]. By understanding how these phenomena emerge mathematically from underlying equations governing evolution states space it becomes easier identify promising strategies improve performance algorithms designed tackle similar challenges future research efforts across disciplines including neuroscience engineering etc...

where $g > 0$ parameterizes coupling strength, $\epsilon_n$ denotes individual particle energies, $V(\cdot)$ defines external potentials such as confining wells or traps, and $|\cdot|$ takes absolute value.

This form generalizes standard QHO models by allowing for nonlinear terms proportional to powers of both occupation numbers ($|φ|^2_n$) and fields ($φ^*_m φ_m^n$). Such higher-order interactions enable rich dynamics not possible with linearly coupled systems alone.

Mode amplitudes satisfy normalization conditions: $$∫ dΩ |ψnl(m)|^2= ∑ l′ ∑ m′ |ψnl′ (−m′)|^2= 1.$$
Here $dΩ$ is the solid angle element, and we sum over all possible angular momentum states. The energy eigenvalues are given by:

$$E_{nl} = ℏω(n + \frac{1}{2})$$

Where $\omega$ represents the oscillator frequency.

We use these mode functions to construct QHO wavefunctions as products of real-valued radial and angular parts: $$\Psi(r,\theta) = R_n(r) Y_l^m(\theta).$$

The radial part satisfies a time-independent Schrödinger equation with discrete energy levels:

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2R_n}{dr^2} + V(r)R_n = Ern,$$

Where $V(r)$ denotes the confining potential, $m$ is particle mass, and $Enl$ represent discrete quantum numbers.

For our purposes here we consider only one-dimensional harmonic potentials so that:

$$V(x)=\frac{kx^{2}}{2}, ~~~~ k>0.$$

This allows us to focus on fundamental concepts without excessive complexity. We can then generalize results for more complicated potentials later if desired.

Resonant field model implementation

To implement Eq.(1), we define an MLFFNN architecture consisting of L hidden layers each containing N neurons with sigmoidal activations. For example,

$f(z_j^{(l)})=\tanh(z_j^{(l)})$, where zj,l=∑i wji,xj,i+bj,l 

Each layer's output vector/parameter matrix contains information about nonlinear couplings between modes via their resonant fields φnl(t).

Specifically, for each lth layer's output vector/parameter matrix (zjl)^{(l)} representing nonlinear coupling coefficients between modes n and m at time t, we define a corresponding input data vector xm,n,t containing mode amplitudes at time t satisfying normalization conditions described above. Then using standard backpropagation techniques,

we train this network to minimize errors in reproducing exact solutions from analytical calculations or numerical simulations of Eq.(1).

Results & Discussion

Numerical simulation setup
We simulate dynamics using second-order Runge-Kutta methods with 100 fs timestep integrating Eq.(1). Initial conditions consist of two identical particles initially prepared in ground state wavefunctions centered around x=0 within infinite well potential barriers extending from -L<x<L.
Analytical solution
To benchmark against exact solutions analytically calculated for specific initial conditions [3], we compare neural network predictions versus analytic expectations under various parameter regimes:
- Coupling strength g vs number Nof oscillators
- Oscillator spacing Δν vs number Noscillators 
- External confinement strength κ vs oscillator spacing Δν 

These parameters control system dynamics which may be difficult to analyze exactly due to nonlinearity effects arising from higher-order terms proportional to powers of occupation numbers |φ|^4n etc., not present in linearly coupled systems alone.

Neural networks learn complex interplay between underlying physics governing quantum mechanics phenomena such as quantization rules and resonance interactions through training process involving many millions of iterations across multiple epochs spanning days/hours depending on hardware configuration used.

scalar field, the scalar field potential $V(\phi)$ and the
coupling constant $\lambda$ are all functions of spacetime. The
latter two parameters may also depend on other fields in the model.
The Lagrangian density for a minimally coupled complex scalar field
$\Phi(x^\mu)$ is given by

\begin{equation}
{\cal L} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\partial_\mu\Phi^*\partial^\mu\Phi -
m^2|\Phi|^2 - V(|\Phi|^2)\right] + {\cal L}_m({\bf x}),
\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\cal L}_m({\bf x})$ represents matter interactions.

In this work we consider a single massive real scalar field with an
exponential self-interaction potential,

\vspace{-0.5cm}

$$V(\phi) = m_0^2 e^{-a |\phi|},$$

\vspace{-0.3cm}

\noindent where $a > 0$. This form of the potential allows us to study 
the influence of exponential self-interactions on both cosmic acceleration 
and structure formation over cosmological timescales. We assume that gravity is described by general relativity (GR), so that our analysis can be extended to scenarios involving modified gravity theories or higher-order curvature corrections.

We solve Einstein's equations perturbatively around a spatially flat background FRW metric:

\vspace{-0.4cm}

$$ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 [dr^2 + r^2 d{\Omega}].$$

\vspace{-0.3cm}

Here $d{\Omega}$ denotes solid angle elements and primes denote derivatives with respect to comoving radial coordinate $r$. The scale factor obeys:

\vspace{-0.4cm}

$$H(r)^{''} + H(r)^{'  2}/(a r^{'} ) - k/a^{'} r^{'} = \rho_{tot}(r). $$ 

\vspace{-0.3cm}


Here prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time $\eta$, which satisfies:  

$v' / c_s' = -(1/3)(k/\Lambda)$. 

Here, $v'$ is velocity divergence, defined as:  
%
%\begin{equation}
%v' := v_r'/c_s'
%\end{equation}
%

\noindent and $c_s'$ is sound speed squared:
%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%c_s'^ { } &:=& \sqrt{{T_p}'/{T_e}'}, \\
%&=& \sqrt{(g_*s')/(g_*e')}\\
%&=& c_s,
%\end{eqnarray*}


\noindent where $(g_*/s')$ and $(g_*/e')$ are relativistic degrees of freedom per unit volume at temperature T'. Hereafter we use units such that G=c=1 throughout.

The energy-momentum tensor for our complex scalar field has components:


$
T_{00}=\rho+P,\quad T_{01}=P',$

$
T_{10}=P',$

$
T_{11}=-(p+\rho)+p',$


where $\rho$, P, p represent total energy density, pressure and intrinsic pressure respectively.


For simplicity we consider only adiabatic perturbations in which entropy remains conserved during evolution; therefore equation-of-state parameter w=p/ρ remains constant throughout expansion history.


Expanding solutions around homogeneous background satisfy:


$h_k''+(k/r)a'h_k'+[w(a)-1]h_k=Q_k(t)e^{ikr}$,


Where h$_k$(t,r) describes spatial fluctuations about homogeneous solution characterized by wavevector k along line-of-sight direction l.o.s., Q$_k$(t) represents source term due to non-adiabatic processes like gravitational collapse or radiation transfer effects influencing growth rate.


Solving above differential equation gives power spectrum P(k,t):

%

\[P(k,t)=A_h(k)[D(z)]^{-6(w-1)}(z)\]


Where A$_h$(k) normalizes amplitude at present epoch z=1107 according to CMB constraints from Planck collaboration~[ref], D(z)=E(z)/H(z), E(z)=(ΩMz²+ΩKz²+Ωλ)/(ΩM+ΩK+Ωλ).


We calculate growth factor D(z):

\[D(a,z)=∫da′f(a′)|δ̈(a′)|/[(Ḣ/H)^₂−ΩKa²]\]

Where f(a’) accounts for nonlinearities between linear theory prediction δlin=a’δb at early epochs when baryons dominate fluid dynamics compared to later epochs dominated by dark matter ρdm=(ΩMρcrit).
resonant wavepackets, quantum vortices, and cosmic strings. The first two of these can be produced in the early universe through topological defects that arise during phase transitions~\cite{vilenkin}. Cosmic strings are long one-dimensional objects formed from breaking of global symmetries during a phase transition. These could have been seeded by the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) process at high temperatures.

In this work we focus on resonant wavepackets as a possible source of dark matter. Resonant waves are coherent oscillations of scalar field modes with frequencies near the Hubble scale $H_0$. They can be produced in scenarios where inflation ends via a sudden drop in energy density, such as an exponential potential~\cite{resonance}:

$$V(\phi) = \frac{\lambda}{4}\left(1 - e^{-m_\phi/\sqrt{2}H_0t}\right)^2.$$

\noindent Here $\lambda$ is coupling constant and $m_\phi$ is mass parameter.

Resonant waves carry momentum but not energy density, so they do not contribute to expansion dynamics or gravitational interactions. However their self-interactions may lead to resonantly enhanced annihilation rates compared to free-streaming particles like neutrinos or photons.


We calculate relic abundance using Boltzmann equation: 

$$n_{relic}(T_r)\simeq n_{rec}(T_c)e^{-M/T_r},$$

\noindent where $n_{rec}$ is number density at recombination epoch T$_c$, M is mass parameter for resonant wave model under consideration, and T$_r$ represents temperature today.

The freeze-out temperature T$_f$ marks when particle annihilation rate equals Hubble expansion rate; below this temperature decays dominate over annihilations leading to stable relic abundance:

\[T_f\simeq 5\times10^8K(M/100GeV)^{-1/2}\]

For our models we consider massive complex scalar fields with exponential self-interaction potentials similar to those considered in Refs.\cite{kumar2017,gubitosi2019}:


\vspace{-0.3cm}

$$V(\Phi)=m^2|\Phi|^2+\frac{\lambda}{4!}|\Phi|^4,$$

\vspace{-0.3cm}

where m$\sim$mP$\sim$h-1Mpc/c$\sim$10 GeV sets characteristic mass scale for resonance production mechanisms explored here.
 
We assume that all parameters governing evolution of background FRW metric and perturbations satisfy standard slow-roll conditions appropriate for inflationary cosmology:
%
%
%

\[N=\int^{a}_{a_i}\frac{da'}{(Ha')^₂}<60,\quad ϵ=∣\dot H/H²∣<1,\quad η=∣δ̇/(a'Hδ̈)∣<1.\]


Where N denotes number e-folds between horizon exit scales k=aH before radiation-matter equality zeq until present day z=1107; δ̈=(d²δ)/(dt²), δ̇=(dδ)/(dt). We define observables O(z):

O(z)=Ωdmh²(z)+Ωb h²(z)/[Ωbh⁄Ωmh⁄] + Ωλ,

Where Ωb,bh represent baryonic/photon densities today relative to critical density respectively.


Constraints from Planck CMB data on parameters governing background FRW metric evolution allow us determine values for initial conditions required by slow-roll conditions above:


\(η=-ϵ+O(N)\)

\(η≃−ϵ\) at horizon crossing k=aH;

\(η≃−ϵ\) at end-of-inflation;

\(η≃−ϵ\) after reheating completes.



These constraints combined with observational measurements constrain values for parameters governing non-linear growth factor D(a,z):


D(a,z)|observed→A_h(k)(z)|observed

Assuming A$_h$(k)(z)$=$const yields constraint on growth factor amplitude A(h).

Using observed value O(b,h) gives constraint on h parameterization:

[h]=constant|observed→A_h(k)(z)|observed



Combining constraints above allows us determine allowed range of masses mφ corresponding to observable relic abundances consistent with observations:

This analysis provides framework allowing us explore connection between resonant wave physics responsible for dark matter formation and underlying particle physics models describing EWSB processes giving rise them.
