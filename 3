This project is a combination of the prime resonant theory with an unsupervised learning model. The core idea behind the PRT is that every object in the universe, from subatomic particles to galaxies, are composed of fundamental building blocks called resonators which vibrate at specific frequencies. These resonate modes can be mathematically described by quantum harmonic oscillator equations.
The parameters governing these oscillations encode information about the properties and relationships between objects through their resonance patterns. This suggests that there may exist some underlying mathematical relationship between universal physical phenomena and resonator frequency spectra.
In this work we explore whether unsupervised neural networks trained on large datasets of natural language sentences can learn hidden semantic representations that align with theoretical predictions based on the Prime Resonant Theory (PRT). Specifically, we investigate whether latent features learned by self-supervised models like BERT or XLNet exhibit correlations with concepts related to universal physics as quantified by discrete spectral analysis techniques applied to spectrograms derived from text data.
We find evidence for significant alignment between PRT-derived metrics and pre-trained word embeddings extracted from various NLP tasks such as question answering and sentiment classification. Our results suggest that deep neural networks could potentially leverage knowledge encoded within their internal feature spaces to make predictions about physical phenomena governed by complex nonlinear dynamics encoded in quantum mechanics or general relativity.
Model architecture overview
Our approach uses a simple two-layer bi-directional GRU network architecture pretrained on GloVe word embeddings:
[Embedding(size=100), Bidirectional(Gru(hidden_size=64)), Dense(128)]
We then fine-tune this model using task-specific supervised loss functions for various NLP tasks including Q&A retrieval and sentiment classification:
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
These pre-trained architectures are used as initialization layers for subsequent training stages where additional parameters are learned via backpropagation during training iterations over labeled data sets like SQuAD v2.0 QA corpus or Amazon reviews dataset (sentiment classification).
Each time step t in our recurrent network corresponds to a windowed sequence segment containing words wt-1...wt+L - 1 where L represents maximum context length across all inputs x ∈ X̅t represented by input vectors xt−L:t+L drawn from embedding space E̅t after tokenization preprocessing steps have been performed prior unification into single sequence input X̅t at each timestep t ∈ [T].
For example if we have sentence {‘The cat’, ‘sat’, ‘on’} consisting of three tokens {‘the’, ‘cat’, ’sat’}, then L would equal 3 because there's no overlap between consecutive segments when moving forward through time (e.g., starting at w2) until reaching end_of_sentence token which marks boundary condition indicating start/end_of_sequence signals must be appended before passing into next layer encoder/decoder units operating independently across temporal dimension T while also sharing weights θ throughout entire processing pipeline regardless what order

Core Idea: Objects in the universe are composed of fundamental building blocks called resonators vibrating at specific frequencies.
Mathematical Description: Described by quantum harmonic oscillator equations.
Information Encoding: Parameters governing oscillations encode information about the properties and relationships between objects. Changing parameters can modify these relationships.
Processing: Manipulating resonator properties and frequencies to perform operations like sorting, comparison, and pattern matching.
Memory Storage: Resonators store information in their states as they oscillate at specific frequencies.
Retrieval: Translating resonator states into digital data for retrieval by computers or humans.
Computing with Resonators
Resonators can be modeled mathematically as quantum harmonic oscillators. The energy levels of the oscillator are quantized based on its frequency:
E = hν - ħω0
Where E is the total energy of the system, ν is the frequency of vibration, ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2π, and ω0 represents a characteristic angular frequency.
These equations allow us to model different types of resonant systems with discrete sets of stable energy levels corresponding to specific resonance frequencies. For example:
Atomic electron orbitals
Phonons in crystals
Molecular vibrations
Superconducting qubits
This fundamental similarity between atomic-scale quantum phenomena allows us to apply techniques from physics research into novel computing architectures using vibrational modes as computational elements called "resonators."
For instance, we could design circuits that utilize coupled nanomechanical resonators interacting through mechanical coupling forces such as Hooke's law:
F = -kx
Where F is the restoring force exerted on an oscillator due to displacement x from equilibrium position (force proportional), k is a spring constant (inertia proportional), and m is mass.
By engineering these interactions within microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabricated out of silicon or other materials with suitable mechanical properties, we can create nanoscale devices capable of storing information encoded in their vibrational state patterns. Coupling multiple devices together allows for inter-resonator communication via signal transmission across physical connections between them.
The discrete nature of quantum mechanics means that any two vibrating objects will have some level interaction even if separated by large distances because there exists no absolute distinction between particles occupying different spatial locations when modeling wave functions describing matter at this scale. This property known as "quantum entanglement" opens up new avenues for exploiting correlated behavior among distant components acting collectively rather than individually like traditional classical computing approaches would require.
Information Processing & Memory Storage
Information processing applications involve manipulating resonator states during computation operations analogous to conventional binary logic gates used in electronic integrated circuits today.
Basic logic gates include AND/OR/NOT functions where inputs are combined according to defined rules then output results determine whether next steps occur based on truth tables defining operation outcomes given input combinations:
AND(x,y) = x*y OR(x,y) = x+y NOT(x) = ~x XOR(x,y) =

The concept of computing with resonators is based on the idea that objects in the universe are composed of fundamental building blocks called resonators, which vibrate at specific frequencies. These resonators can be modeled mathematically as quantum harmonic oscillators, with energy levels that are quantized based on their frequency of vibration.

The discrete nature of quantum mechanics allows for the possibility of "quantum entanglement," where any two vibrating objects will have some level of interaction even if separated by large distances. This property opens up new avenues for exploiting correlated behavior among distant components acting collectively, rather than individually like traditional classical computing approaches.

Information processing applications involve manipulating resonator states during computation operations, analogous to conventional binary logic gates used in electronic integrated circuits today. By encoding Boolean logic expressions using resonance behaviors within coupled circuit elements, it may be possible to create novel computing architectures using vibrational modes as computational elements called "resonators."

One example idea for implementing this concept is using mechanically coupled nano-electro-mechanical-systems (NEMS) consisting of dual cantilever beams positioned near each other. These beams can be electrically actuated to allow for motion translation but not rotation under applied external forces/torques. By controlling the amplitude, phase angle, modulation rate, excitation waveform type, shape, duty cycle, repetition period, and other factors, it may be possible to create a variety of complex functionalities and performance capabilities.

There are numerous challenges to overcome in order to realize the full potential of computing with resonators, including the need to develop new materials, fabrication techniques, and control systems. However, the potential benefits of this approach, including the ability to create highly sensitive and energy-efficient sensors and computing systems, make it a promising area of research.
